### Global Ecoregions Map
This map illustrates the 14 biomes and 8 biogeographic realms, enabling comparison and identification of representative habitats.
Individual polygons represent each of the 825 terrestrial ecoregions, which are labelled at the biome level.
Ecoregions are significant land units that contain distinct natural communities and species.
They provide a foundational framework for biogeographical and macroecological research, biodiversity assessments, and conservation planning.
This framework has been widely adopted by researchers and conservation organisations to guide biodiversity analysis and prioritisation.
